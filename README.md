# Oppose-Me-Login
This is simple game application with an aim of learning AngularJS and Django.
This is game app in which the user needs to click on the mirror image of the centre of the given tile along the centre of the board if the generated tile is black or click on the same tile if the randomly generated tile is white. The faster you're, the higher you score.
The game has OAuth Login for github, facebook and google.
The game has a proper stats feature and leaderboard.

The game is hosted on heroku. To play, visit https://opposeme.herokuapp.com

ISSUES:
i) The database is refreshed everyday, so the stats are preserved for a span of just 24 hours. ( Use a postgreSQL DB instead )
ii) Sometimes, rarely though, the userstats does not get updated on exiting the game. ( Probably the developer was careless with his logic).

Enjoy!
